Sudoku solver

Program solves (finds all possible combinations) sudoku using back tracking algorithm. Input files are Sudoku0.txt, Sudoku1.txt ...
all containing different sudoku.

Usage: compile using $: make  and run with $: ./sudoku_solver
       To change source file, edit file name in line 22 of main.cpp file


-Sudoku0 - empty template, program will start to searching all possible combinations (it will take veeeery long ;P)
-Sudoku1 - template with 1 possible solution
-Sudoku2 - template with 193 possible solutions (with less than 17 given numbers in template there will be more than one possible solution)
-Suodku3 - again template with 1 possible solution

*in templates 0 mean empty cell
*input template has to be 9x9
*output is saved in 'wyniki.txt'

Notes:
-Program isn't resistant to input data with errors (too few numbers, or letters on imput, unsolvable inputs are detected).
 Fix in the next update.
-Input change without editing source code in the next update.
-Change of sudoku size in the next update.
